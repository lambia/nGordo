# nGordo
This should be a simple tool for syntax highlighting.

It's focused on helping reverse engineering of RFID dump or other files with a fixed structure.
You can take notes to mark where the variables are stored and save the template to test your theories on other files.

The name it's in honour of Gordo(n) Freeman of Half-Life.
I reversed the position of the "N" cause this is a "reverse" enginering tool, and also to tribute the iteration (n-times Gordo).
